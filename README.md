## Background

At Depop one of the tasks a front end developer is often faced with is to bring a design to life and to communicate with an API in order to surface the information used in the design.

With this exercise we are interested in seeing how you approach this task.

A few notes before you start:

- Don't go crazy! Your free time is important to us.
- Don't worry if you don't have the time to finish the entire exercise or you get stuck.
- In a team communication is important and we like to share ideas, solutions and problems together!

## Exercise

This task is to create a basic shop page

A simple design can be found here for guidance: <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XssSAHxZD2T66V0SxysKkkBSVqbGW5QX>

The API for the product data is available at: <https://5c78274f6810ec00148d0ff1.mockapi.io/api/v1/products>

### Requirements

- Retrieve data from the given API endpoint;
- Display the list of products;
- Add functionality to like/unlike a product;
- Add functionality to show/hide sold items;

### Tips

- Consider what makes a good application that will go into production
- You can use any library you want. (A good starting point to setup a modern web app is with "Create React App")
- A tested component is a reliable component!
- A readme detailing how to run the project and any notes you'd like to leave is always appreciated

### Submission

Push your exercise in a repository and send us the link. Alternatively, you can also email the zipped files. 

Good luck and enjoy!



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
